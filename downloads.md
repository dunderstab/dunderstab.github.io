#### Disclaimer: Semble only works on Debian-based systems

<h3><a download="install.sh">Download the installer.</a></h3>

To install semble, first <a download="install.sh">download the installer</a> and find the directory it is in.

Open a terminal in that directory and type the following command:

```
bash installer.sh
```

It will now commence an installation of SembleLang.

Some commands in the installer run as `sudo`, so you will need to enter your passcode.

Now, to check that semble is properly installed just run the command `semble` and see if it returns:

```
usage: semble <file>
```
